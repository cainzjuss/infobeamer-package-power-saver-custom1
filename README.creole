= Power Saver package

Very simple power saving example code. Just add this package
to your existing setup and it will automatically power off
your screen and the time configured in {{{service}}}.

Right now there is no configuration GUI available, so you
have to edit {{{service}}} and then use your modified
version. Pull requests welcome.

This package requires at least hosted os version 5.
